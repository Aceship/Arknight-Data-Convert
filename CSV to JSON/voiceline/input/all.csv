"char_291_aglina","Angelina","交谈1","Conversation 1","信使的工作并不轻松。送件人和收件人可能都有着自己的野心，包裹里也许埋藏着惊人的秘密......如果信使光盯着脚下的路，是会因为看不见落脚点而坠落的。","It's not like the job of a transport is carefree or anything. In both sending and receiving luggage, everyone has their own schemes, and inside of those, some unbelievable things could be hidden. There are times I've gotten so wrapped up in the path in front of me that I've lost sight of my destination.","トランスポーターの仕事、そんなにお気楽ってわけじゃないんだ。荷物を送る側にも受け取る側にもそれぞれの算段があるし、その中にはとんでもない秘密が隠されてるかもしれない。目の前の道に拘り過ぎると目的地を見ゆしなってしまうこともあるんだ。",
"char_291_aglina","Angelina","交谈2","Conversation 2","因为我的母亲来自东国，所以我的名字不那么像叙拉古人。大家都不怎么相信这是名字，所以我就干脆把安洁莉娜当作代号使用了。","My mother is originally from the Far East, so my real name doesn't really make me sound like a Syracrusian. On top of that, it doesn't really sound like a name either, so I gave myself the codename Angelina, which is much easier to say.","お母さんが極東出身だからか、私の本名ってあまりシラクザ人ぽっくないんだよね。それも響きも名前ぽっくないってよく言われるから、呼びやすいようにアンジェリーナだけをとって、コードネームにしたんだ。",

I mean, no matter how long I wait, a star probably wouldn't notice how I feel either, right?","見晴らしのいいデッキだと星空がよく見えるね。あのポツっと光ってる星、見える？言い伝えだとあの星がパートナーになる星を見つけて、抱き合ったり、ダンスしたりするんだって。でも、いつまで待てばいいのかな？あたしもいつまで待てば星が私の気持ちに気づいてくれるかな。",
